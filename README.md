# Hardware Anomaly Detection using System Logs

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **hardware anomaly detection using system logs**. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze system log data and identify potential hardware failures, performance issues, and system anomalies before they cause critical problems.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the [Loghub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub) dataset collection, which provides a comprehensive set of system logs from various computing environments including:

- **Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux, Mac
- **Distributed Systems**: HDFS, Hadoop, Spark, Zookeeper
- **Supercomputers**: BGL, HPC, Thunderbird
- **Mobile Systems**: Android, HealthApp
- **Server Applications**: Apache, OpenSSH, OpenStack
- **Standalone Software**: Proxifier

The Loghub dataset contains structured and unstructured log files with corresponding templates, making it ideal for training anomaly detection models.
